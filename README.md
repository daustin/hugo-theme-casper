## Multiple authors configuration

In addition to providing data for a single author as shown in the example above, multiple authors
can be configured via data/authors/\*.(yml, toml, json) entries. If the key provided in
.Site.Params.author matched a data/authors/\* entry, it will be used as the default. Overrides
per page can be done by a simple author = other_author_key entry in the front matter. For those
pages where you want to omit the author block completely, a .Params.noauthor entry is also
available.

Example author definition file:

``` yml
name: John Doe
bio: The most uninteresting man in the world.
location: Normal, IL
website: http://example.com
thumbnail: images/john.png

```

Example override author per page file:
``` toml
+++
author = ""
date = "2014-07-11T10:54:24+02:00"
title = ""
...
+++

Contents here

```

## Menu configuration

On top right of the screen, a "Subscribe" button is displayed with a link to the RSS feed.

When you define a menu in the main config file, Then a menu button is displayed instead of the subscribe button
When the use clicks the menu button, a sidebar appears and shows the subscribe button and all items defined in the main config file

> :information_source: If your added a metadata like ```menu="main"``` in a content file metadata, it will also be displayed in the main menu

Example of a menu definition in main config file.


``` toml
[[menu.main]]
  name = "My Blog"
  weight = -120
  identifier = "blog"
  url = "/"

[[menu.main]]
  name = "About me"
  weight = -110
  identifier = "about"
  url = "/about"
  
```

## Metadata on each content file, example

``` toml
+++
author = ""
date = "2014-07-11T10:54:24+02:00"
draft = false
title = "dotScale 2014 as a sketch"
slug = "dotscale-2014-as-a-sketch"
tags = ["event","dotScale","sketchnote"]
image = "images/2014/Jul/titledotscale.png"
comments = true     # set false to hide Disqus comments
share = true        # set false to share buttons
menu = ""           # set "main" to add this content to the main menu
+++

Contents here
```

## Create a section "mysection" with custom vars and content

Set up list content file and content for a first post
```
hugo new -k custom_list_content mysection/list_content.md
hugo new mysection/first_post.md
cp themes/layouts/section/mysection.html ./layouts/section/mysection.html
```

In the layout you can specify custom cover, title, description for mysection list
```
{{ .Scratch.Set "custom_title" "my custom section title" }}
{{ .Scratch.Set "custom_cover" "images/pic.jpg" }}
{{ .Scratch.Set "custom_description" "my custom section description" }}

{{ partial "list.html" . }}

```

The section list will display content from type custom_list_content in the heading, and treat all other types as normal posts
```
+++
date = "2016-04-15T19:41:40-04:00"
draft = false
type = "custom_list_content"
+++

### Mysection list content

```

## Create a taxonomy (tag) layout

Set up tag layout file
```
cp themes/layouts/taxonomy/mytax.html ./layouts/section/tag.html
```

In the layout you can specify custom cover, title, description for tag list. You can see here there is different info depending on what the tag values are.
```
{{ $tax_value := .Title }}

{{ if eq $tax_value "first" }}
{{ .Scratch.Set "custom_title" "my firsts title" }}
{{ .Scratch.Set "custom_cover" "images/pic.jpg" }}
{{ .Scratch.Set "custom_description" "firsts from each section" }}
{{ end }}

{{ if eq $tax_value "second" }}
{{ .Scratch.Set "custom_title" "my seconds title" }}
{{ .Scratch.Set "custom_cover" "images/pic.jpg" }}
{{ .Scratch.Set "custom_description" "seconds from each section" }}
